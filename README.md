General purpose cogs for Red V3

## Cogs
### Index
Allows you to browse a [Red-Index](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-Index/) repo/cog index directly from your Red instance, helping you discover new repos and cogs. This is integrated with the core Downloader, so you can easily install a new repo or a new cog by clicking a reaction. Yay technology!
