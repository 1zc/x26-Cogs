General purpose cogs for Red V3

## Cogs
### Index
Allows you to browse a [Red-Index](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-Index/) repo/cog index directly from your Red instance, helping you discover new repos and cogs. This is integrated with the core Downloader, so you can easily install a new repo or a new cog by clicking a reaction. Yay technology!
### Defender
Protects your community with automod features and empowers the staff and users you trust with advanced moderation tools.
You can read [my write-up about this cog here](https://x26.it/2020/09/06/project-showcase-defender.html).
To give a TL;DR, the arsenal this cog offers is entirely customizable, it allows you to decide who these automod features should target and how.
It is designed to counter common patterns of bad actors and tries to solve the issue of low mod availability by allowing the trusted members of your community to intervene when you can't.
It also offers the moderators of your community a variety tools to closely monitor suspicious behaviours and better handle large scale attacks.
